## 📝 My Decisions & Notes

- **Next.js App Router** chosen for its modern structure and better routing/layout handling.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design ease.
- **Framer Motion** added for scroll-based fade-in and subtle animations.
- **Shadcn UI** to speed up component styling without sacrificing customizability.
- Focused on keeping code modular, clean, and easy to extend.

## 📌 To Do (Optional Enhancements)
